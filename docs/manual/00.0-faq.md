- **Q:** Why this manual is composed of problems and solutions?

  **A:** I learned from Pieter Hintjens' unfinished book [Scalable C](https://readonly.link/books/https://books.readonly.link/scalable-c/book.json), I admire the author's ideas.

- **Q:** Why this manual uses examples instead of rigorous specification?

  **A:** I learned this from [The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art), which uses examples to specify algorithms, I feel it really practical and easy to understand.
