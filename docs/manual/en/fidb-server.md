title: FiDB Server

We have a FiDB server in Node.js:

- [github.com/fidb-official/fidb](https://github.com/fidb-official/fidb)

A backend developer can deploy
FiDB's HTTP API by the following command:

```
fidb serve:database [path]
```

For more information, please see [the Docs section](https://github.com/fidb-official/fidb#docs)
