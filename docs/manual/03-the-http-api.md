title: The HTTP API
---

We want to use [HTTP API](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110) to operate data in FiDB.

The aim is to enable a developer to describe rules about HTTP API declaratively,
thus almost never need to write backend API code over database anymore.

We will do this little by little.

## Data Operations

Firstly, the most basic four operations is the **CRUD**
-- **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete.

- To **create** data, `POST` to the path with the data.

  For example, after the following `POST`s:

  ```
  POST users/xieyuheng

  { "name": "Xie Yuheng" }

  POST users/xieyuheng/projects/inner

  { "name": "inner", "description": "My inner universe." }

  POST users/xieyuheng/projects/pomodoro

  { "name": "Pomodoro", "description": "üçÖ A Pomodoro timer." }
  ```

  We will create the following data files:

  ```
  users/xieyuheng/index.json
  users/xieyuheng/projects/inner/index.json
  users/xieyuheng/projects/pomodoro/index.json
  ```

- To **read** data, `GET` the path.

  For example, if we have the following data:

  ```
  users/xieyuheng/index.json
  users/xieyuheng/projects/inner/index.json
  users/xieyuheng/projects/pomodoro/index.json
  ```

  The `GET` requests would be:

  ```
  GET users/xieyuheng
  GET users/xieyuheng/projects/inner
  GET users/xieyuheng/projects/pomodoro
  ```

- To **update** the whole data, `PUT` the path with the data.

  We first need to read the data to get `@revision`.

  ```
  GET users/xieyuheng
  ```

  Result:

  ```
  {
    "name": "Xie Yuheng",
    "@path": "users/xieyuheng",
    "@revision": "1b0d4dc0b6e68853aa0005b03c059a47",
    "@createdAt": 1677377821957,
    "@updatedAt": 1679424624733,
  }
  ```

  Update the whole data:

  ```
  PUT users/xieyuheng

  {
    "name": "Ë∞¢ÂÆáÊÅí",
    "@path": "users/xieyuheng",
    "@revision": "1b0d4dc0b6e68853aa0005b03c059a47",
    "@createdAt": 1677377821957,
    "@updatedAt": 1679424624733
  }
  ```

- To **update** some properties of a data, `PATCH` the path with the data.

  We first need to read the data to get `@revision`.

  ```
  GET users/xieyuheng
  ```

  Result:

  ```
  {
    "name": "Ë∞¢ÂÆáÊÅí",
    "@path": "users/xieyuheng",
    "@revision": "2b983c7a51376a61747eb9d79da13c77",
    "@createdAt": 1677377821957,
    "@updatedAt": 1679424824733
  }
  ```

  Update only some properties:

  ```
  PATCH users/xieyuheng

  {
    "@revision": "2b983c7a51376a61747eb9d79da13c77",
    "country": "China"
  }
  ```

- To **delete** data, `DELETE` the path with the `@revision`.

  We first need to read the data to get `@revision`.

  ```
  GET users/xieyuheng
  ```

  Result:

  ```
  {
    "name": "Ë∞¢ÂÆáÊÅí",
    "country": "China",
    "@path": "users/xieyuheng",
    "@revision": "3f71a2d894180a2145ea7b05e2931e15",
    "@createdAt": 1677377821957,
    "@updatedAt": 1679425024733
  }
  ```

  Delete the data:

  ```
  DELETE users/xieyuheng

  {
    "@revision": "3f71a2d894180a2145ea7b05e2931e15"
  }
  ```

## File Operations

Since we are using file system as database,
beside operations on JSON data files,
we also want to operate on other kinds of files
such as markdown, image, mp3 and so on.

- **Problem 3.1:** How to distinguish kinds of resources referenced by a path?

- **Solution 3.1:** We can add `kind=...` to the query string of a request,
  where the value of `kind` explicitly denotes the kind of resource.

  For examples, value can be `data`, `file`, `directory` and so on.

  We require an implementation to view the value of `kind` as case insensitive,
  so a user can write both `kind=Data` and `kind=data`.

I feel good about this solution,
because it is scalable,
i.e. we can add as many kinds as we want in the future.

Now we are ready to specify the HTTP API about file operations.

TODO

- **Problem: 3.2** It is not convenient to always have to write
  `kind=data` and `kind=file`.

- **Solution: 3.2** We can identify some situations
  where it is unambiguous to omit `kind=...`.

  It is unambiguous to omit `kind=file`,
  if we are simply reading a file and the given `path`
  is to an existing file (instead of a directory).

  For `kind=data`, since it is the most used use case of our system,
  we view it as the default when `kind` is omitted,
  when the given `path` does not exist or the given path is to a directory.

## Directory Operations
